Package fsfffb provides Fast and Slow
feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) inhibition (FFFB)
based on incoming spikes (FF) and outgoing spikes (FB).

This produces a robust, graded k-Winners-Take-All dynamic of sparse
distributed representations having approximately k out of N neurons
active at any time, where k is typically 10-20 percent of N.
