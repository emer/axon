# Objrec

This network is the axon version of the CCN sims [objrec](https://github.com/CompCogNeuro/sims/tree/main/ch6/objrec) model.

# Parameter notes

* Depends critically on adapting inhibition in the V4 layer (first to kick in), along with later adapting inhib in IT and Output.  Without this, V4 increased activity drives positive feedback dynamic and system becomes unstable. This is similar to what happens in the LVis larger scale model.
