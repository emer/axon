# BG Dorsal

This is a test of the PCore model of basal ganglia (BG) function, in the **dorsolateral striatum** (DLS) and associated BG circuits. See also the [bgventral](../bgventral) for the simpler ventromedial striatum (VMS) model.

Full documentation is at [CompCogNeuro](https://CompCogNeuro.org/bg-dorsal-simulation) and the [basal ganglia](https://CompCogNeuro.org/basal-ganglia) page there. 

# Results

The params have been relatively thoroughly "tweaked" at this point: see `paramtweak.go` for tweaking code. Overall the model is remarkably robust to +/- 20% changes from default params.

The learned weights to the BG clearly show that it is disinhibiting the appropriate action at each step in the sequence.

# TODO:

* STN pool-based instead of shared full

* Set number of cycles per trial in terms of BG motor gating timing: constant offset from onset of VM gating timing, with a cutoff for "nothing happening" trials.
    * Attempted an impl but is difficult with CaBins -- tried shifting bins but awk..

* "CL" not beneficial (implemented as direct MotorBS -> Matrix pathways): rel weight of 0.002 is OK but starts to actually impair above that.  Likely that a functional cerebellum is needed to make this useful.  Also, investigate other modulatory inputs to CL that might alter its signal.  Key ref for diffs between CL and PF: LaceyBolamMagill07: C. J. Lacey, J. P. Bolam, P. J. Magill, Novel and distinct operational principles of intralaminar thalamic neurons and their striatal pathways. J. Neurosci. 27, 4374â€“4384 (2007).

* Learning in the other parts of the pcore circuit -- might help auto-adjust the parameters.  Need to figure out what logical learning rules would look like.
