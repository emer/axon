It has two state variables, M (v-gated opening)\nand H (v-gated closing), which integrate with fast and slow time constants,\nrespectively.  H relatively quickly hits an asymptotic level of inactivation\nfor sustained activity patterns.\nIt is particularly important for counteracting the excitatory effects of\nvoltage gated calcium channels which can otherwise drive runaway excitatory currents.\nSee AKsParams for a much simpler version that works fine when full AP-like spikes are\nnot simulated, as in our standard axon models."}, {Name: "GABAB", Doc: "GABA-B is an inhibitory channel activated by the usual GABA inhibitory neurotransmitter,\nwhich is coupled to the GIRK G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (K) channel.\nIt is ubiquitous in the brain, and critical for stability of spiking patterns over time in axon.\nThe inward rectification is caused by a Mg+ ion block *from the inside* of the neuron,\nwhich means that these channels are most open when the neuron is hyperpolarized (inactive),\nand thus it serves to keep inactive neurons inactive.
