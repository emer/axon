# Bench LVis

bench_lvis is supposed to be an easy-to-understand, easy-to-run network that nevertheless has the same performance characteristics as the big LVis network.  It is parameterized by default to match the size and performance characteristics of the standard LVis model.

As compared to examples/bench_objrec, bench_lvis has much less code.

See [bench_results](bench_results.md) and [lvis_actual](lvis_actual.md) for results on Mac, Linux AMD EPYC and GPU (M1 vs. A100), on the benchmark and the actual LVis model.
