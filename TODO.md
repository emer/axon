* special VS, DS etc learning rules that involve pre-post synaptic activity factor could use CaSyn?
However, the SPNs are phasically active in ways that then don't make sense according.

* novelty SC inputs to BG dorsal CINs -- represent CINs explicitly instead of just PF

* More etrace param search
* Sahp vs. KNa -- do we really need all these variations of the same thing?  yes!
* KNa is essential in Lvis .05 should be new std though?

* Gaba=.015 vs .012 and Decay.Glong = .3 in deepvision..

* SpikeCaSyn = 12 is essential in Lvis -- try in other models vs 8
	+ doesn't work at all in deepfsa

* update Go code docs throughout per the updated CCN docs
