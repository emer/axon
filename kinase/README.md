# Kinase Learning Implementation

This implements the Kinase learning rule, with multiple different variants being explored.

See https://github.com/Astera-org/axon/tree/master/examples/kinaseq for exploration of the implemented equations, and https://github.com/ccnlab/kinase/tree/main/sims/kinase for biophysical basis of the equations.
