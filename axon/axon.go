// AxonNetwork defines the essential algorithmic API for Axon, at the network level.
// These are the methods that the user calls in their Sim code:
// * NewState
// * Cycle
// * NewPhase
// * DWt
// * WtFmDwt
// Because we don't want to have to force the user to use the interface cast in calling
// these methods, we provide Impl versions here that are the implementations
// which the user-facing method calls through the interface cast.
// Specialized algorithms should thus only change the Impl version, which is what
// is exposed here in this interface.
//
// There is now a strong constraint that all Cycle level computation takes place
// in one pass at the Layer level, which greatly improves threading efficiency.
//
// All of the structural API is in emer.Network, which this interface also inherits for
// convenience.
